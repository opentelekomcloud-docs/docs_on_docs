GitHub Onboarding
=================

Most of our documentation is hosted on GitHub, a service based on, but
not the same as Git. To work with GitHub, an account is needed.


How to join GitHub
------------------

1.  Go to https://github.com/ .

2.  On the top right corner is a button with "sign up".

3.  Enter your corporate email address and press "continue".

4.  Create a strong password.

5.  Enter a username e.g. johndoe

6.  Would you like to receive updates? I suggest opting out with
    entering "n".

7.  Verify your account by solving the task to prove you aren't a bot.

8.  Click on the "create an account" button.

9.  You are almost done! GitHub just sent you a launch you that has to
    be entered to create the account ultimately. Note: The code has to
    be entered manually and you can't enter it via copy & paste.

10. You are asked with how many people you are working with and if you
    are a student or a teacher. This personalization can be skipped at
    the bottom of the Website. I suggest skipping this step.

11. Congratulations! You just created your GitHub account!
