IDE Recommendations
===================
-NotepadPP
	NotepadPP version 8.2 and the addon “reStructuredText_NPP”
	Use the following link to GitHub for further instructions 
	https://github.com/steenhulthin/reStructuredText_NPP

-Vim 
	Vim is a markdown editor which can be utilized for RST. For less experienced Users it would be better to use Visual Studio Code. VS Code is more user friendly in UI Design and overall experience
	For Vim the plugin “RIV” is a good choice RIV has good support for RST.

-Nano
	Next IDE is also targeted at more experienced users that aren´t interested in nice UI Designs. 
	But I wouldn´t recommend using Nano because there are no RST Plugins for Nano

-Atom
	Atom greets you with the promise being “a hackable text editor for the 21st Century” 
	Customization and Packages can be installed trough the integrated App store. 
	To use RST in Atom you can install “rst-preview” 
	https://atom.io/packages/rst-preview

-Eclipse
	Eclipse was originally developed for Java but with Plugins it can be modified to
	run man programming languages as well as RST
	https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/liclipsetext

-Sublime
	Sublime is a proprietary Text editor fpr Windows, Mac and Linux. 
	It supports Many useful future proof features like ARM64 or GPU rendering
	RST Support is built right in and the programming language can be changed in the lower right hand corner.
